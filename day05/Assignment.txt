What is pep8?

PEP8 also known as Python Enhancement Proposal.
PEP8 defines how a python code should look. PEP 8 is Python's style guide. It's a set of rules for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability. Writing code to a specification helps to make large code bases, with lots of writers, more uniform and predictable, too.
